	<body>
A stylishly spectacular extravaganza, <title>Moulin Rouge</title> is hard
to categorize;
it is, at different times, a love story, a costume drama, a musical, and a
comedy. Director <person>Baz Luhrmann</person> (well-known for the very hip
<title>William
Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet</title>) has taken some simple themes - love,
jealousy and obsession - and done something completely new and different
with them by setting them to music.

	<rating>5</rating>

	<teaser>Baz Luhrmann's over-the-top vision of Paris at the turn of the
century is witty, sexy...and completely unforgettable</teaser>
