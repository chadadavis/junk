This code compiles under g++ 2.6.2, but exceptions don't
work there. Consequently use -DNoExceptions on the compilation line.
Also, for g++, I have not used separate compilation, so
compile only the main, and other files will be included.

Under CC, compile everything separately.
On my system, the template directory occasionally
gets corrupted and must be removed and everything
recompiled.

Please report bugs to weiss@fiu.edu.
The AW web page will eventually have a link to
a page that I will maintain that will contain errata
and an up-to-date version of the code.
